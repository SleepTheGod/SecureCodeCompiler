# SecureCodeCompiler
Reflects the primary function of the project (compiling C code securely).

# Features
Secure Execution: Input is sanitized to prevent code injection, and the backend uses security headers and anti-malware practices.
Modern Web Interface: A user-friendly, responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Robust Backend: A Node.js backend using express, body-parser, and exec to compile and execute C code securely.
Real-Time Output: Displays real-time compilation and execution results in an interactive interface.
Safety Measures: Headers, input sanitization, and CORS handling for maximum security.

# SecureCodeCompiler

## Overview

**SecureCodeCompiler** is a web application that allows users to compile and execute C code securely through a modern, user-friendly interface. Built with **Node.js**, it includes built-in security features to ensure safe code execution by sanitizing inputs and preventing malicious activities such as code injection or system calls.

## Features

- **Secure Compilation:** Uses `gcc` to compile C code on the server side, with input sanitization to prevent malicious code execution.
- **Real-Time Output:** Displays the compiled output or error messages directly on the web page after execution.
- **Security Headers:** Implements industry-standard security headers using `helmet` to protect against a variety of web vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** CORS is enabled to allow access from authorized origins, useful for third-party integrations or specific use cases like NSA-approved networks.
- **Minimalistic Design:** The frontend is styled with a focus on readability and ease of use.
